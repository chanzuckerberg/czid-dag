# Description
*The intended change, motivation and consequences.*

# Version
[ ] I have increased the appropriate version number in https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag/blob/master/idseq_dag/__init__.py
[ ] I have added release notes for my new version to https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag/blob/master/README.md

Version numbers for this repo take the form X.Y.Z.
- We increase Z for a change that does not add or change results in any way. Example: adding a log statement.
- We increase Y for a change that adds results, changes results, or has the potential to change results. Example: changing a parameter in the GSNAP command.
- We increase X for a paradigm shift in how the pipeline is conceived. Example: adding a de-novo assembly step and then reassigning hits based on the assembled contigs.
