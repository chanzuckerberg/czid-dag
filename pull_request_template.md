# Description
*The intended change, motivation and consequences.*

# Version
- [ ] I have increased the appropriate version number in https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag/blob/master/idseq_dag/__init__.py. Guidelines here: https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag/blob/pr-template/README.md#release-notes
- [ ] I have added release notes for my new version to https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag/blob/master/README.md#release-notes

# Tests
- [ ] I have verified in IDseq staging that the pipeline still completes successfully:
    - [ ] for single-end inputs
    - [ ] for paired-end inputs
    - [ ] for FASTQ inputs
    - [ ] for FASTA inputs.
- [ ] I have validated that my change does not introduce any correctness bugs to existing output types.
- [ ] I have validated that my change does not introduce significant performance regressions or I have discussed with the team that the benefits of the change are substantial enough that we're comfortable accepting the size of the measured performance penalty.

# Notes
*Optional observations, comments or explanations.*
